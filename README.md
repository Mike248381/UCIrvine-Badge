The code here is presented in jupyter notebook because I want the results to be readable inline.

Have fun with it! If you have your own solution, feel to share with me.

There is also a python file for the terminal. To run that, make sure you have download the csv into the same folder from which you intend to run the python.

Have fun with this now!
